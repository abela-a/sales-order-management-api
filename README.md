# üíµ Sales & Order API

Technical test for backend developer position at PT. Dibuiltadi Teknologi Kreatif. This repository contains a complete RESTful API for a Sales & Order System. The API manages customer, order, product, sales, and user, allowing operations such as creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of records. This project demonstrates clean code design, database schema implementation, unit testing, and performance tuning techniques.

## üìë About this Project

This project showcases my backend development expertise, with a focus on designing and implementing robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs. Laravel is a highly popular framework widely adopted in production environments. It offers numerous built-in features that simplify handling a variety of use cases. Another reason for choosing Laravel is my extensive experience with it. I have been using the framework for over four years. This familiarity allows me to efficiently apply its best practices to deliver high-quality solutions.

### Tech Stack

-   Language: PHP `8.2`
-   Framework: Laravel `12.10`
-   Database: MySQL `8.0`
-   Documentation: Swagger
-   Testing: Pest

### Design Pattern

I use the Repository Design Pattern in this project. The Repository Design Pattern in Laravel is utilized to separate data access logic from the business logic of the application. This approach offers benefits such as more structured code, easier testing, and flexibility to accommodate changes. By using a repository, you can replace or modify the data source (e.g., switching from a database to an external API) without altering the business logic in controllers or services. Additionally, this pattern facilitates the implementation of SOLID principles, particularly the Dependency Inversion Principle, as controllers or services depend only on contracts (interfaces) rather than direct implementations. This makes the application easier to maintain and extend.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Requirements

Before running tests, ensure you have a dedicated testing database configured. This prevents your development or production data from being affected during testing.

1. Add a testing database configuration to your `.env.testing` file:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=testing

DB_PASSWORD=
```

2. Run the tests using one of the following commands:

```bash
php artisan test
# or
./vendor/bin/pest
# or HERD
herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest
```
